<h2>Car Rental Application</h2>
<p>This project is a comprehensive car rental system developed in Java, providing an interface for users to rent or return cars. It encapsulates the core functionalities of a car rental service, including managing cars, customers, and rental transactions. The application is built upon object-oriented principles, demonstrating encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>

<b>Core Components:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Car: Represents the car object with attributes like car ID, brand, model, and availability status.</li>
  <li>Customer: Represents the customer, including customer ID and name.</li>
  <li>Rental: Manages rental transactions, associating a car with a customer and the rental duration.</li>
</ul>

<b>Key Functionalities:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Adding Cars and Customers: Facilitates the registration of new cars and customers into the system.</li>
  <li>Renting a Car: Allows customers to rent available cars for a specified duration, with dynamic pricing based on rental days.</li>
  <li>Returning a Car: Enables customers to return rented cars, updating the system and making the cars available for future rentals.</li>
  <li>User Interface: A simple console-based menu system that lets users interact with the application to rent or return cars, implemented using the Scanner class for input.</li>
</ul>

<b>Implementation Highlights:</b>
<ul>
  <li>The system utilizes <code>ArrayList</code> for managing cars, customers, and rentals, demonstrating dynamic data management in Java.</li>
  <li>Features a menu-driven interaction flow, guiding the user through renting and returning cars with input validations and informative prompts.</li>
  <li>Employs object-oriented practices, with classes encapsulating specific entities and functionalities, making the code modular and reusable.</li>
</ul>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
<p>The Car Rental Application project showcases the application of Java's object-oriented programming capabilities to solve real-world problems. It provides a solid foundation for building more complex systems, illustrating key OOP concepts and Java's core features such as collections, user input handling, and conditional logic.</p>
